# Pascal-sort
Realising different sorting algorithms and comparing them

Program objective:

Implement two methods for sorting an array of integers (the bubble method and the Shell method, non-increasing sorting) and compare them experimentally. For each of the implemented methods, it is necessary to provide for the possibility of working with arrays of length from 1 to N (Nâ‰¥1).

When implementing each method, calculate the number of element comparisons and the number of element movements (either exchanges of pairs of elements, or transfers of elements to new places - depending on the method) performed during the sorting process.
